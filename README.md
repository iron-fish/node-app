### Usage

Once your environment is set up its possible to run app:

Use `yarn start` or `yarn start:<mode>` to run app.
By default `dev` mode is used, also `demo` and `production` modes are available.

To test build use `yarn build`, there is also 3 mode for build `demo`, `dev`, `production`, `dev` is default.

# Create application

Just run `yarn package` and executable files will be builded into `./out` folder.
By default `demo` mode is used for crating package use `production` mode to create release version (`yarn package:production`).

# Releases

Releases are based on tags. In order to do a release:

Update package.json version, submit a PR and merge it to the master.

Run `git tag -a "vX.Y.Z" -m "vX.Y.Z"` where `X.Y.Z` is the major.minor.patch version.
(for demo version release use `demo-v` prefix instead of `v`)

Run `git push --tags`
